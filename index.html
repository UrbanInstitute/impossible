             <p>Under dim street lamps, a jimmy slides down a pane of glass, past the rubber molding, and hooks the locking mechanism that seals this vehicle from the outside world. With a tug the door pops open, a teenage boy slides in, and quickly hotwires the ignition. In seconds, he’s off, headed towards a chop shop where he hopes to quickly flip the car for cash. Not because he’s a thrill seeker, or a deviant, but because his family’s starving.</p> 

                <p>Across town, a teenage girl puts on her best clothes. She primps her hair, picks up her purse, and steps outside to meet an older man she is dating. She is not in love with him, but continuing to go on these dates helps her to eat and pay bills.</p>

                <p>And down the street, a teenage brother and sister stop by their cousin’s apartment. He is in a gang that has access to cocaine and if they can convince him to sell them some, they could hawk it at school for three times their investment. With that money, they could buy food for a month.</p>

                <p>We’ve known about all of these dangerous behaviors for a long time. What we’re starting to learn is that too often the motivation to get involved in such illicit activities is hunger, desperation, and survival instincts.  </p>  

                <p>We are learning that teenagers make risky decisions in big and small communities alike, because family poverty increased, working class wages stammered, and cash assistance from government programs wilted.</p>

                <p>Indeed, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service estimates that 6.8 million young people ages 10 to 17 don’t have enough to eat, including 2.9 million who have dangerously little food.</p>

                <p>Research shows that the food budget is one of the first things to be pared down when times get tough for a family. Under such conditions, these households become food insecure: that is to say, they struggle to acquire enough affordable, nutritious food to feed the whole family at a healthy level.</p>

                <p>The ramifications are innumerable. But looking specifically at teenagers, we know they are at a critical stage of their development and that hunger undermines their physical and emotional growth, stamina, academics, and job performance. </p>
                    
                    <p>As a result, policymakers in recent years have focused on the rising amount of hunger experienced by the youngest children in school. These efforts are helping, but they don’t sufficiently account for the needs of hungry teenagers. </p>

                <p>Policies generally overlook the unseen consequences that the constant hunger pangs and the unrelenting stress that comes with food insecurity have on teens outside of school.</p>

                <p>So over the course of three years, researchers from the Urban Institute sought to get a more complete picture of how food insecurity affects teenagers. They spread out across the country, focus-grouping 193 teenagers by gender at 10 different communities.</p>

                <p>The picture that emerged was a portrait of impossible choices being imposed upon teenagers whose transitions into adulthood are happening way too fast.</p>

                <p>To truly understand how some teens could find themselves rationally choosing to shoplift, steal, sell drugs, date for money, or join a gang instead of excelling in high school, graduating college, and developing a professional career, one must first grasp the conditions that even put these dangerous options on the table for consideration.

                    <h3><a name="disadvantaged"></a>Structurally Disadvantaged</h3>
                    
                    
                    <p>In low-income communities, jobs are typically scarce. The positions that are available most often pay minimum wage, offer an inadequate number of hours, or otherwise require skills, education, and experience that low-income parents have not garnered.</p>

 <p>As a result, the wages these parents earn and benefits they might receive — such as federal cash and food assistance — are typically not enough to pay the rent, utility bills, transportation costs, or grocery expenses.</p>

 <p>Food-insecure families often try to tighten their belts by reducing their use of electrical appliances; they buy cheaper, low quality food products; and they reduce meal portions, or even skip some.</p>

 <p>But in many cases, these evasive actions are not enough to stave off hunger and the family starts running out of food by the middle of the month.</p>

 <p>Under such circumstances, teenagers — especially those with younger siblings — feel a responsibility to help the family keep more food on the table.</p>

 <p>“I will go without a meal if that’s the case,” said a teenage girl interviewed in Chicago. “As long as my two [younger] siblings [are] good, that’s all that really matters to me.”</p>
         
 <p>Something that is often overlooked is that teens in hungry families are food consumers and decision-makers too. In interviews across all sites teens talked about the scarcity of quality grocery stores in their neighborhoods, the resulting higher prices, and the general lower quality of food options that are within striking distance.</p>

 <p>“Some people go to Aldi or Walmart, but it really depends on how much money you have,” said a teenage girl from Illinois. “Where you get food from depends on income.” </p>

 <p>They also talked about the extra costs and efforts families must expend to use public transportation to go to far away grocery stores with healthier options and cheaper prices. And getting home is not always as easy as getting to the store.</p>

 <p>“If you buy too [much] stuff, you can’t ride the bus,” said a teenage boy from Washington, DC. Instead they have to pay either taxis, or strangers from outside the stores, for rides home.</p>

 <p>Without affordable, higher quality options close by, teens often settle for food at the easily accessible local fast food restaurants, drug stores, gas stations, and corner markets.</p>

 <p>“When you’re broke, you get the dollar menu,” said a teenage boy from San Diego.</p>

 <p>On top of that, researchers found that teens are often unaware of resources within their community — such as food pantries — where they can go to get free food. In other cases, teens said they were aware of these resources, but were under the false impression that they are unqualified to receive food there. And in at least one case, teens below the age of 18 were ineligible to get food at a pantry.</p>

 <p>Perhaps the most formidable difficulty is that many teens experiencing food insecurity often hide their hunger for fear of ridicule. </p>

 <p>“Teens feel more bad about [hunger] because they have more insecurities about themselves,” said a teenage boy in San Diego. “Poor kids are the outcasts. People [are] nasty to you.”</p>

 <p>As a result, teens often turn down help from perceptive teachers, neighbors, and other well-intentioned community members.</p>

 <p>Instead they rely on a trusted circle of people to get by. They go to their closest family members and friends houses for meals, they quietly ask them for money at lunchtime, all the while looking to avoid detection and humiliation. </p>

 <p>So with parents already working hard to feed the family, little food in the pantry, and a desire to hide their needs, many teens look for ways to help their families make ends meet.

  <p>When faced with severe food insecurity, many teens begin to feel the weight of adult responsibilities.</p>

 <p>Some come to this point when their struggling parents pressure them to take on a share of the family’s breadwinning duties, but most realize they want to help when they observe for themselves the realities of their families’ material hardships. </p>

 <p>“You start to get worried … like your family is in danger,” said a teenage boy in Portland. “They won’t have enough food. [You] start to want to get jobs to provide for basic needs.” </p>

 <p>But like their parents, teenagers have a limited selection of jobs available to them within their communities. Even when they find one, the job is typically a minimum wage retail position at a fast food restaurant, drug store, gas station, grocery store, or clothing shop. </p>

 <p>As a result, teens with little work experience end up competing against adults for the limited number of low-skill positions.</p>

 <p>“It can be difficult,” said a teenage boy in Los Angeles. “We don’t have experience. No one is willing to give it to us and it’s hard to get a job when all they want is experience.” </p>

 <p>School can also be a barrier. </p><br>

 <p>Employers increasingly want workers to have flexible schedules so that they can fill shifts with greater ease. Unfortunately when jobs offering school-friendly schedules aren’t hiring, some teenagers from desperate families drop out to pick up the needed income. Sometimes they return to school, but often they don’t. </p>

 <p>As an alternative, some teens work “under the table” in restaurants, corner stores, or flea markets. Others find work at subsidized youth employment programs run by local government agencies or non-profits. </p>

 <p>And others seek entrepreneurial opportunities within their own communities, like mowing lawns, babysitting, raking leaves, or walking dogs. </p>

 <p>“[You start] out trying to find a job and when that doesn’t work out, you find a quick hustle,” said a teenage boy in North Carolina. </p>

                    <p>When some teenagers are able to earn money, they first address their own needs — like food, clothes, or school supplies — to free up cash for their family’s other expenses. If they have some money left, many pitch in to pay the bills. Others give all their money directly to their parents so that they can cover everything.  </p>

                    <p>Teens also give money to help out siblings and friends that might also be struggling with food insecurity, or other material needs. </p>

 <p>But too often teens looking to add to their family’s collective income can’t earn enough in their job market. It’s in these moments of need when some teens make the choice to earn money outside of the legal economy, to better help their families stock the pantry.

                    <h3> <a name="risks"></a>Dangerous Risks</h3>    
     <p>Unmitigated hunger leads to desperation. And desperate moments sometimes lead to compromising choices.</p>

 <p>Teens at all the study sites told researchers that peers in their community open themselves up to a bevy of dangerous risks to meet their own, and their families, basic needs.</p>

 <p>“People have to do other things,” said a teenage boy in Illinois. “They do what they have to do to survive because not everyone can go out and get a job.”</p>

 <p>For some it is a matter of just walking into a store and with a sleight of hand, pocketing something to eat, or intentionally not scanning something at a self-checkout kiosk.</p>

 <p>“I ain’t talking about robbing nobody,” said a teenage boy in Chicago.” I’m just talking like going [in] there and [getting] what you need. If you need to do that, that’s what you need to do.”</p>

 <p>While some teens talked about shoplifting as a fairly common strategy — with some starting as early as age 7 — even more serious illegal activity can quickly escalate.</p>

 <p>For food insecure teenage boys, theft and selling drugs are common strategies for earning money to pay for food and other vital needs.</p>

 <p>Indeed, teenage boys said, stealing items such as smart phones, shoes, jewelry, bikes, car stereos, or other vehicle parts provides a quick way to get some cash.</p>

 <p>They also said that with so many gangs present in their communities, drug dealing is a fairly easy hustle to get into. Gang affiliation and drug dealing poses personal and legal risks to teenagers, but the harmful side effects extend to even younger members of the community too.</p>

 <p>“Drugs, alcohol, everything,” said a teenage girl in rural Oregon. “[The] bad things people used to just do in high school has spread to the junior high and down to the elementary school.”</p>

 <p>Teenage girls are more vulnerable to a different type of insidious risk: sexual exploitation. </p>

 <p>We know that many teens have sex: approximately 41 percent of teens say they are sexually active, according to a 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey.</p>

 <p>In many ways, social media and text messaging fuel sexual activity, teens said, because a lot of peer pressure is used to elicit the exchange of nude photos.</p>

 <p>Food insecure teen girls also said of that their communities could be “coercive sexual environments” where men commonly catcall or inappropriately leer at women.</p>

 <p>The combination of these elements can be toxic: Teens at all 10 of the study locations and in 13 out of 20 focus groups talked about girls having sex for money. </p>

 <p>Often this takes the form of “transactional dating,” meaning a teen regularly sees and has sex with someone — often a significantly older man — and in exchange receives, meals, material goods, or cash. It’s harder to recognize, but teens interviewed for the study said it’s pervasive.</p>

 <p>“It’s really like selling yourself,” said a teenage girl in Portland. “ You’ll do whatever you need to do to get money or eat.”</p>

 <p>Teen girls said they preferred this strategy to other hustles because they think it’s pretty normal in their community, it’s less policed, and overall it carries less risk.</p>

 <p>A less common, but no less harmful strategy cited by teens in two locations is when kids intentionally sabotage themselves in school, or get arrested on purpose, to ensure continued access to food.</p>

 <p>“It might not be the best food, might not be the best place to be, but it’s a roof over your head,” said a teenage girl in Portland. “And every single day they eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner.”</p>

 <p>All of these strategies — shoplifting, stealing, drug dealing, selling sex, or self-sabotage — threaten teens’ futures. They risk failing to finish school, bodily harm, arrest, incarceration, and having long-standing criminal records that could inhibit their ability to get a job in the future.</p>

 <p>With a clearer understanding of the connection between food insecurity and the risky strategies adopted by some teens facing dire realities, it is vital that greater priority be given to addressing this issue. The question is: what are the best ways to go about solving such a complex problem?

                    <h3>Hope in New Columbia</h3>

  <p>Urban Institute researchers sat in a room full of teenagers in the North Portland public housing community known as New Columbia. It was springtime in 2014 and the researchers were in town to lead focus groups that would inform their teen food insecurity study. But these kids provided more than just details about coping strategies; they offered an entirely new direction for addressing the issue.</p>
  <p>Before there was New Columbia, there was Columbia Villa, a 460-unit community originally built to house defense workers during World War II, and later transitioned into low-income housing after the war. </p>
<p>But time deteriorated the units and the ‘80s brought drugs, gangs, and violence to Columbia Villa, where poverty could be found in every direction and good jobs were hard to find.</p>
<p>Seeing the need for a fresh start, Home Forward — the housing authority of Portland and Multnomah County — applied for and won $35 million in HOPE VI grants to rebuild this community.</p>
<p>Hence, in 2005, from the same 82-acre footprint sprung: 850 new, colorfully-painted, mixed-income housing units; vibrant parks and sports fields; a modern community center; and a new school.</p>
<p>Still, for many New Columbia residents, the aforementioned structural disadvantages that lead to food insecurity survived the transformation.
So when teens in the New Columbia focus groups said they wanted the chance to lead the creation of a program to address their peers nutritional needs, Urban jumped at the chance to partner with Feeding America and pilot this innovative approach to fighting teen food insecurity.</p>
<p>The theory is that teenagers are much better positioned to recognize incognito hunger; that they are uniquely capable of designing a program that would appeal to young people and get them to participate; and that they can break through other barriers to help get famished teens food before they make impossible choices.</p>

<p>With this concept in hand, the Urban Institute partnered with Feeding America to secure $400,000 in donor support from the Con Agra Foundation and launch this experiment in Portland. </p>
<p>“They understand what the risky behaviors have been around food insecurity,” said Assefash Melles who was hired to help guide New Columbia’s youth. “They want to address it with their peers themselves.”
Melles effectively functions to create a safe space where New Columbia’s children can share and address the issues they encounter in their lives. Many of them are from refugee families that fled different countries in search of safe ground. Some have already seen a lot in life.</p>
<p>To address these needs — as well as food insecurity, cultural barriers, and other difficulties related to growing up in their community — Melles runs two group meetings per week and always has her door open for private visits. She also seeks out and connects kids and their family members to any wraparound services that they might need.</p>
<p>In addition to Melles, the Urban Institute recruited the assistance of Food Works and the Oregon Food Bank to help create the pilot at New Columbia. Both organizations participated in sessions during the summer of 2014 to help these teenagers develop their own program to address teen food insecurity.</p>
<p>From the meetings emerged the Youth Community Advisory Board, or YCAB.
“The youth felt really empowered by [the summer sessions] and they just wanted to replicate that,” said Kate Benedict, a program manager at the Oregon Food Bank. “They said, ‘we just need a space in our community where everyone can feel what we felt all summer.’ Where they feel like their voices are heard and there is a safe space to engage with each other.”
Food Works — a 2.25-acre organic farm that runs a youth employment leadership program —provides consulting on how to develop YCAB around leadership and food curriculum. The farm also employs some of YCAB’s members so that they can help their parents with expenses and bring food home from the farm.</p>
<p>“There’s a ton of issues that are creating food insecurity,” said Mikael Brust, the supervisor of Food Works’ youth employment leadership program. “I think to really have a space for these young people to really examine those issues and think about trying to address them in creative ways [is special].”</p>
<p>The fruit of all this work is Harvest Share, a monthly event where the Oregon Food Bank drops off ample fresh organic food to be distributed to the residents of New Columbia. And all of it is designed, planned, managed, and handed out by YCAB members and their young protégés.
Harvest Share launched in November and since then YCAB has reviewed and refined their plans and processes after each event to get better results the next time around.</p>
<p>In June, all the food was handed out long before Harvest Share’s designated hours of operation expired and the team began to think about asking the Oregon Food Bank for even more supplies. Still, YCAB aims to do a better job of reaching teens, not just their parents, so the members continue to tinker with new strategies.</p>
<p>New Columbia’s teens also aim to create a larger youth empowerment program that goes beyond addressing teen food insecurity. They envision volunteering at a nearby retirement home and creating even more teen support groups to help in other areas of life.
These are better days in New Columbia. Children have established a safe space to find and provide counsel to each other, and also find themselves and their place in the community. Simultaneously, more food is reaching those who need it and it is the kids who are leading the way.

                    <h3><a name="hunger"></a>Solving Hunger</h3>

<p>The experiment playing out at New Columbia shows significant promise and could become a model that other communities around the country modify and use to address teen food insecurity in their own neighborhoods.</p>

<p>But beyond youth empowerment programs, other steps are needed to address the national scourge of teen food insecurity. Urban Institute researchers said policymakers and practitioners should consider a number of additional short-and long-term strategies to better accomplish this end.</p>

<p>Immediate ways they recommend for keeping teenagers well nourished and away from risky strategies, include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>	Increasing the amount of food provided by the federal food assistance program known as SNAP. A 2015 White House study shows that many SNAP beneficiaries run out of food before the end of the month. It would make a big difference if the amount provided actually met families’ needs.</li>
<li>	Extending school-based meal programs to cover afterhours and summer months.</li>
<li>	Tweaking charitable feeding programs — such as those run by food pantries — to become more accessible and welcoming to teenagers.</li>
<li>	Expanding initiatives that provide full-time and part-time job opportunities to include all low-income youth. Providing opportunities for teens to earn wages that actually help their families make ends meet — while simultaneously getting them work experience and steering them away from risky strategies — is essential.</li>
<li>	Making trauma-informed care and counseling available for teens and their parents. Many parents have also had to adopt risky strategies. This type of care could significantly help all who have been burned by them.</li>
</ul>
            
<p>In the long-run, researchers said the only way to entirely eliminate teen food insecurity is to uproot it at its epicenter: family poverty. To accomplish such a huge task, policymakers, the business community, and practitioners have to empower low-income parents. A few strategies offered for achieving this end, include:</p>

<ul>
<li>	Creating more and better job opportunities. There is an acute shortage of sustainably-paying jobs in low-income communities and that makes food security nearly impossible for these residents.</li>
<li>	Improving access to existing jobs. Parents who have made their own impossible choices have a harder time getting work. Reasons often include: a lack of job experience; transportation issues; no access to childcare; or a criminal history. Working with employers to expand the pool of eligible job applicants to include such parents would make a big difference.</li>
<li>	Re-investing in cash assistance for struggling families. Dollars for the cash assistance program known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families were significantly cut in recent years as states tightened eligibility requirements and repurposed funds. Reinvigorating this program to better help struggling families and loosening the eligibility criteria would relieve a lot the pressure teens feel to make compromising choices.</li>
            <li>	Expanding housing assistance. Rent is usually the largest of a low-income family’s monthly expenses, yet only one in four eligible families receives a deep federal housing subsidy.  And some teens living in subsidized housing still experience food insecurity. Providing significant assistance to more families, and helping families with vouchers move to better neighborhoods, would help more teens avoid having to make impossible choices.</li>
</ul>
            
<p>Many of the ways that teenagers cope with food insecurity remain illusive and related policymaking would certainly benefit from additional qualitative and new quantitative studies. Yet we also know what is driving teen food insecurity and, in many ways, we know exactly what needs to be done to attack the root of the problem. It just takes some bold steps. </p>
